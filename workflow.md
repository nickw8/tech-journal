# My Workflow
1. Go to the project's directory
1. Run the `tmx` command
1. `vim` is on the left, zsh is on the right
1. Make sure I'm in the correct branch
1. In `vim` use `<C-p>` to get a fzf list of files to edit.
1. Select one and edit
1. To edit a new one repeat above 2 steps  steps
1. To switch to a different buffer either use `<C-p>` again or `<C-b>` for fzf buffer list
1. Run commands directly from vim with `<Leader>vp` and see results in `zsh`
