### What is a Tech Journal?

A Tech Journal is a place where you document your lessons learned and Aha-moments from programming and using different technological tools. It is a great place to document how you figured out certain problems or step-by-step guides on how you accomplished something amazing. You can also document your common gotcha's or frequently looked up commands or keystrokes in hopes to improve your memory.

### Best Practices

*  Start slowly; some log is better than no log
* Don't postpone writing something down. Somebody else will come along, and you'll forget your bright idea.
* Use a consistent format so that you can easily go back and find something. 
  * This is why I use markdown. I can easily grep through the local files for what I need and reading it on GitHub looks pretty
* Add code examples and examples of the results if possible using code blocks, not images (thinks searchable)
* Use **TODO** to mark items. Grep makes it easy to find. And if needed, you can use a git-hook to compile into a seperate file.
* Don't hesitate to add stuff. Even if it seems stupid or easy for others. This is for you and to help make you better.
